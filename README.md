League of legends Application
An application used to develop your own League of legends champion - Marksman, Tank, Fighter, Assassin or Mage, built with React, JavaScript and CSS. For server I have used Express and for database - MongoDB.

Currently the project is finished as for the Project defense, but will be developed further ahead, so it can show the best of me for my job applications.

To start the app - open the app directory in Visual Studio code and type "npm start".
To start the server - open the express-res-api folder, located in the app directory, in Visual Studio code and type "npm start".

This was an almost one month project built during the ReactJS course - march.2021 in Softuni. There were some requirments which we had to use for building our project and of course we could use extra technologies. 

I wanted to build an application where users could enjoy their favorite game - League of legends. They would be able to develop their own champions with their own items and participate in the Ranking system.

The main challenge for me was the Register form. I had some problems connecting it with the Server as for the cors policy. I literally lost a whole day trying to resolve the issue, but at the end I developed my google abilities for sure. And the Register form is wokring safe and sound. Other issue for me was to write clean and well structured code, but I tried hard and I like the result very much.

At the end of the day I really like the Application I created. My first React project after an year and a half hard studying and meanwhile going to work on completely different job.

My future plan for this Application is to develop it more for which I have many ideas and will do my best.
